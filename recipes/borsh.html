                    <li>Peel potatoes, chop them and send them to boil. 
                        <p>Meanwhile, make frying: chop the onion finely, send it to fry in vegetable oil.</p></li>
                    <li>While frying onions, chop carrots on a medium grater, send it to the onions. </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Add chopped beets and tomatoes (you can tomato paste). I sometimes use homemade morsels, it turns out very tasty. 
                        <p>In general, with fresh tomatoes borscht turns out the most delicious. Chop garlic, it is also sent to the vegetables. 
                            <p>Then add a little water and steam our vegetables.</p></p> </li>
                    <li>When the potatoes are boiled a little, send to it our paste and shredded cabbage. 
                        <p>In spring, when there are fresh vegetables and young cabbage, it is a sin not to cook such a simple and tasty borscht.</p> Now you can salt and season it to taste. </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Cook until the vegetables are ready and turn off. Borscht should insist at least an hour. </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>If you leave it for 5 hours, its flavor will be even richer.
