        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes 4-5 pieces</li>
            <li>Tomatoes 2-5 pieces(Or tomato paste)</li>
            <li>Onions 2 pieces</li>
            <li>Carrots 1-2 pieces</li>
            <li>Cabbage 500 grams</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil 100 grams</li>
            <li>Garlic 2-4 cloves</li>
            <li>Herbs(to taste)</li>
            <li>Beets 1 piece</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel potatoes, chop them and send them to boil. Meanwhile, make frying: chop the onion finely, send it to fry in vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>While frying onions, chop carrots on a medium grater, send it to the onions. </li>
            <li>Add chopped beets and tomatoes (you can tomato paste). I sometimes use homemade morsels, it turns out very tasty. In general, with fresh tomatoes borscht turns out the most delicious. Chop garlic, it is also sent to the vegetables. Then add a little water and steam our vegetables. </li>
            <li>When the potatoes are boiled a little, send to it our paste and shredded cabbage. In spring, when there are fresh vegetables and young cabbage, it is a sin not to cook such a simple and tasty borscht. Now you can salt and season it to taste. </li>
            <li>Cook until the vegetables are ready and turn off. Borscht should insist at least an hour. </li>
            <li>If you leave it for 5 hours, its flavor will be even richer. Do not spare vegetables and tomatoes, then you will ask for a recipe for everyone who tries such a lean borscht. </li>
            <li>Before serving, sprinkle with herbs and, if not fasting, add sour cream. Borscht according to this recipe turns out very tasty and hearty, despite the fact that it is lean</li>
        </ol>
